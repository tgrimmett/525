GitHub is a large code repository that is popular with developers and companies. It hosts entire projects, documentation, and code. According to an article on The Verge there are 85 million repositories hosted and 28 million developers contribute to them. Some of these developers fear Microsoft due to their prior reputation of attacking Linux with patent battles. One of the concerns is that Microsoft might abuse their power of ownership to monitor trends in software development in order to launch rival products. Also, a lot of big tech companies such as: Apple, Facebook, and Google use GitHub. Since it is owned by a competitor company, will they continue using it or seek an alternative? 
According to the article on ZD Net, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has stated that Microsoft loves open source developers and is all-in on open source. During an analyst and press call about the acquisition he said "Judge us by the actions we've taken in the recent past, our actions today and our actions in the future."
Gitlab is a GitHub alternative and has seen a tenfold increase in the daily amount of repositories on the service the day before Microsoft amount the GitHub acquisition according to the Computer World article. BigBucket also claimed to have seen a spike in numbers. 
A large tech company hosting competitorsâ€™ code and projects seems like a conflict of interest. If I was part of a competitor company of Microsoft, I would be concerned with using it as a platform to host my projects and all related information.
